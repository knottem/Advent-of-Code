# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event that features a series of coding puzzles that are released daily during the month of December. The puzzles are designed to test your problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding abilities.

## How to Use this Repository

Each day's puzzle has its own directory, named according to the day of the month (e.g., day01/, day02/, etc.). Within each directory, you will find the solution code and any supporting files that were necessary to solve the puzzle.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event created by Eric Wastl, a software developer from the United States. The event started in 2015 and has since gained a large following in the coding community. The puzzles are designed to be challenging, but not impossible, and are suitable for programmers of all skill levels.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Eric Wastl for creating Advent of Code and providing such engaging puzzles to solve. I would also like to thank the community of developers who participate in this event and share their solutions online. Without their support and encouragement, this project would not have been possible.
